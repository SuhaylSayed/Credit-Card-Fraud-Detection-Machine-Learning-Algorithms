# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Machine-Learning-Model
R-based Classification And Regression Tree machine learning model developed using various training and sampling methodologies to detect credit card fraud

# Objective

The median fraud loss in Canada represents about 5% of annual revenues, quite close to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) estimate of 7% of annual revenues for all U.S. organizations. 

Traditionally, rule-based algorithms have been used to detect credit card fraud in real time. These algorithms, which are based on strict rules, are time-consuming and costly to maintain. They also have a difficult time identifying hidden patterns and responding to new situations that they have not explicitly been trained for. My objective is to develop a more effective and efficient machine learning model making use of various machine learning and sampling techniques. 


# About the Data


The data set is meant to mimic real life fraud detection. It is unbalanced and has some incorrect flagging (some outlier fraud cases arenâ€™t flagged). This means that it is difficult to use traditional supervised learning to train our models. These challenges must be addressed, they are outlined below.

Challenges:
- Unbalanced data
    - Less than 0.5% credit card transactions are fraud
- Operational Efficiency
    - Less than 8 sec to flag a transaction
- Incorrect flagging
    - Excessive incorrect flagging must be avoided




# About the algorithms 

The data is very imbalanced - the vast majority of the cases are legitimate. If the model is trained based off of the imbalanced data it will tend to favour the majority case (= legitimate) causing a large classification error for the fraud cases. To better train the model a more balanced distribution must be used.

The following sampling methods will be used to balance our data and train the machine learning model. 

Random over-sampling (ROS) - Increase the number of fraud transactions by creating duplicates of the already present fraud cases.

Random under-sampling (RUS) - Decrease the number of legitimate cases by random removal. 

Bot (RUS & ROS) - Increase the number of fraud transactions and decrease the number of legitimate transactions. 

Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) - Over-sample minority class (fraud transactions) by creating synthetic fraud cases

Once the data is balanced we will use it to train a Classification And Regression Tree (CART) as our predictive model
